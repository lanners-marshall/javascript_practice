Dear Stripe Hiring Manager,

I’m very interested in discussing the possibility of employment at Stripe. I’m a Full-Stack Web Developer with a focus on front-end technologies (React, JavaScript). In addition, I have over 6 years of customer service and 2 years of office management  experience. I am also an excellent problem solver and dedicated optimizer.

I believe I would be a great fit for Stripe because Stripe needs people who deeply care about quality, who are curious to learn all aspects of the tech stack, and who are willing to take ownership of their codebase. My current web development experience, along with my previous experience in customer service and office management, makes me uniquely qualified. In my most recent project worked on a full stack application written in Python Django for backend and react frontend. I took ownership of developing several components in React, integrating Redux, integrating the backend endpoints with the frontend, working with designers to implement the UI, and collaborating with engineers on the frontend and backend to make sure we met the customers expectations. 

I would love to speak further about possible employment at Stripe sometime this week. If you’re interested, or have any further questions, feel free to reach out by phone or email. Thank you for your time and I look forward to speaking with you soon!
Regards,

Marshall Lanners
